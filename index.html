    <div><p>Proxima Centauri b: Orbiting the closest star to our solar system, Proxima Centauri, this Earth-sized exoplanet lies within the habitable zone, where conditions might be right for liquid water.</p></div>
    <div><p>Kepler-186f: This planet is notable for being the first Earth-sized exoplanet discovered in the habitable zone of another star. It orbits a red dwarf and could potentially have conditions suitable for life.
    </p></div>
    <div><p>HD 209458 b (Osiris): One of the first exoplanets detected transiting its host star, Osiris is a hot Jupiter located about 159 light-years away. Its atmosphere is being studied for signs of weather patterns and atmospheric composition.
    </p></div>
    <div><p>TRAPPIST-1 System: This system has seven Earth-sized planets, three of which are in the habitable zone of their star. The potential for varied environments makes it a prime candidate for studying habitability.
    </p></div>
    <div><p>51 Pegasi b: The first exoplanet discovered orbiting a sun-like star, this hot Jupiter orbits very close to its star and has paved the way for many detection techniques used in exoplanet research today.
    </p></div>
    <div><p>
        LHS 1140 b: A super-Earth located about 40 light-years away, it is within the habitable zone of its host star and has been studied for its potential atmosphere, making it a candidate for the search for life.
